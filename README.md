# Extra Credit

#### Command Design Pattern
`Button.java` and `RenderPanel.java`

#### Singletons 
`ImageLoader.java, StateSelector.java, etc`

#### Dependency Injection
In `App.java`
```java
DB db = DB.getInstance();
db.use(new MongoDB());
```
#### Database
The game is hooked up to MongoDB for saving games, loading games, and loading config files.

#### Maven
See `pom.xml`

#### Build from command line
```mvn clean install assembly:single```

#### JUnit
See `test` folder

#### Support levels other than Beginner
Support `Beginner`, `Standard`, `Tournament`

#### Configuration Files
The game downloads a set of configuration files when the application starts. Because of this, we are able to change variables, such as the player's speed, remotely. The published game runs on the "live" configuration. Different configuration versions (e.g. "test") can be used before making live changes. If no internet connection is available, or the configuration files have been remotely turned off, the game will use a pre-defined config file.

See `Config.java` for more.

#### Core features of the application that are not in the required implementation milestones
- Player's can move via keyboard input (not a point and click game)

#### Interactive Graphics

#### Random Map Generation

#### Crystite

#### Fancy Ids :bowtie:
When saving a game, the user is given a "fancy" id. The id is generated by combining adjectives and nouns randomly. This way users don't have to sign up for accounts. Instead they get an awesome phrase to keep.
